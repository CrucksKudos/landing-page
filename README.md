# Landing Page - The Odin Project

This is a project from **The Odin Project** curriculum, where I recreated a landing page based on a design provided by the course. The goal was to practice **HTML** and **CSS** concepts, including layout building with Flexbox and basic styling techniques.

## Project Overview

The landing page is structured into multiple sections, each styled to match the provided design as closely as possible. The focus was on creating a visually appealing and responsive layout while practicing problem-solving skills. The design served as a guide, and minor customizations were made to personalize the project.

## Features of the Page

- **Header**: Includes a logo and navigation links, styled using Flexbox for proper alignment.
- **Hero Section**: Features a bold title, a subtitle, a call-to-action button, and a placeholder image.
- **Information Section**: Displays multiple cards with images and accompanying text, using Flexbox to create a responsive grid layout.
- **Testimonial Section**: Includes a quote and author attribution, styled to match the design's typography and spacing.
- **Call-to-Action Section**: Contains a centered block with a strong message and a button for user interaction.
- **Footer**: Displays copyright information with a clean, minimalistic design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To create the structure of the page.
- **CSS**: To style the elements and apply the Flexbox layout.
- **Google Fonts**: For typography customization.
- **Git**: For version control during development.
